Feature: User Navigation Journey
  As a user, I want to navigate through the Magento website to different sections and product details pages so that I can easily find what I'm looking for.

Scenario: Users are Able to Navigate to "Men Jacket" Section
  Given the user navigates to the home page
  When the user hovers over the "Men" menu item
  And the user hovers over the "Tops" menu item
  And the user clicks on the "Jackets" menu item
  Then the title of the page should be "Jackets"
